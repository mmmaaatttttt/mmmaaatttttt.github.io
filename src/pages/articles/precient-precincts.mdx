Over the past few years, I've read two books that have really left a lasting
impression. One of them is called [The Merchant of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming](https://www.amazon.com/Merchants-Doubt-Handful-Scientists-Obscured/dp/1608193942).
The subtitle says it all; it's an absolutely depressing true story about how a
small group of scientists waged a campaign against science itself, with
remarkable success.

The other is called [Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America](https://www.amazon.com/Give-Us-Ballot-Struggle-America/dp/1250094720).
Once again, it's all right there in the title. This one's the absolutely
depressing true story about how a small group of racists waged a campaign against voting rights for historically disenfranchised groups, again with remarkable success.

While these topics may sound like they fall under umbrellas of science, history,
or civics, there's plenty of related mathematical conversations to be had as
well. In terms of climate change, I wrote a story [last year](https://mattlane.us/stories/warming-dots/) on general mathematical models
of how natural resource depletion can affect populations. In this story, I'd
like to turn a mathematical lens on the topic of voting, and slap a coat of
paint on what would otherwise be a bunch of tabular data.
