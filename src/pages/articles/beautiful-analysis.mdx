_[Beautiful Stories From Anonymous People](https://www.earwolf.com/show/beautiful-anonymous/)_
(a.k.a. _Beautiful / Anonymous_) is a podcast with a simple premise: "One phone
call. One hour. No names. No holds barred." Created by comedian
[Chris Gethard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Gethard) in 2016, every
episode features Gethard and an anonymous caller, who phones in to the show for
a one-hour conversation. The caller can hang up at any time, but Gethard must
stay on the line for the full hour.

What began as an experimental idea for a podcast has evolved into a show that
gifts listeners with moments of real human connection. Sometimes these moments
are funny, as one might expect from a podcast hosted by a comedian, but more
often than not they hit different notes. Conversations span a wide variety of
topics: anxiety about the future, the death of a loved one, relationship
struggles and triumphs, and, sometimes, the regularity of one's bowel movements.

In a society that often feels increasingly disconnected, these weekly calls are
a helpful reminder of our shared humanity.

It probably goes without saying that I'm a fan of the podcast, and Gethard's
work in general. He wears many hats on the show: comedian, confidant,
empathizer, friend. But if there's one thing Gethard is not, it's a lover of
mathematics.

Gethard's negative math feelings are well-documented. Even his
listeners are aware of it. For example, in [one episode](https://www.earwolf.com/episode/deaf/) 
Gethard chats with a deaf caller via the aid of a sign language interpreter. At
one point, the topic of lipreading comes up. Here's what the caller has to say
(emphasis added): 

> I'm actually a pretty bad lipreader, even though I do use it. That's
> something with lipreading, that's another pet peeve that a lot of deaf people
> have, is expecting to lipread. I mean, we do it out of survival, but **I almost
> look at lipreading the way that you talk about how much you hate math.**

This disdain for mathematics even creeps into Gethard's other works! In his 2018
book [Lose Well](https://www.amazon.com/Lose-Well-Chris-Gethard-ebook/dp/B076P4Q652),
while writing about some of his experiences teaching improv classes, Gethard
writes (again, emphasis added):

> My students were very good, but they had developed the bad habit of turning
> their art form into a math problem to solve. **Art can never be math.**

To be honest, I can't blame him. Unfortunately, most people have had at least
one traumatic mathematical experience. But if you're like Chris Gethard -- if
math makes you feel varying degrees of anxiety, repulsion, existential dread,
and / or rage -- I'd like to invite you to turn the tables with me, and examine
some of Gethard's work through a mathematical lens.

Gethard may not have a high opinion of math, but what does math have to say
about him? Let's find out!
