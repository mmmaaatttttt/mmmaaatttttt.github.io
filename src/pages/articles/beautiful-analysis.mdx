_[Beautiful Stories From Anonymous People](https://www.earwolf.com/show/beautiful-anonymous/)_
(a.k.a. _Beautiful / Anonymous_) is a podcast with a simple premise: "One phone
call. One hour. No names. No holds barred." Created by comedian
[Chris Gethard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Gethard) in 2016, every
episode features Gethard and an anonymous caller, who phones in to the show for
a one-hour conversation. The caller can hang up at any time, but Gethard must
stay on the line for the full hour.

What began as an experimental idea for a podcast has evolved into a show that
gifts listeners with moments of real human connection. Sometimes these moments
are funny, as one might expect from a podcast hosted by a comedian, but more
often than not they hit different notes. Conversations span a wide variety of
topics: anxiety about the future, the death of a loved one, relationship
struggles and triumphs, and, sometimes, the regularity of one's bowel movements.

In a society that often feels increasingly disconnected, these weekly calls are
a helpful reminder of our shared humanity.

It probably goes without saying that I'm a fan of the podcast, and Gethard's
work in general. He wears many hats on the show: comedian, confidant,
empathizer, friend. But if there's one thing Gethard is not, it's a lover of
mathematics.

Gethard's negative math feelings are well-documented. Even his
listeners are aware of it. For example, in [one episode](https://www.earwolf.com/episode/deaf/) 
Gethard chats with a deaf caller via the aid of a sign language interpreter. At
one point, the topic of lipreading comes up. Here's what the caller has to say
(emphasis added): 

> I'm actually a pretty bad lipreader, even though I do use it. That's
> something with lipreading, that's another pet peeve that a lot of deaf people
> have, is expecting to lipread. I mean, we do it out of survival, but **I almost
> look at lipreading the way that you talk about how much you hate math.**

This disdain for mathematics even creeps into Gethard's other works! In his 2018
book [Lose Well](https://www.amazon.com/Lose-Well-Chris-Gethard-ebook/dp/B076P4Q652),
while writing about some of his experiences teaching improv classes, Gethard
writes (again, emphasis added):

> My students were very good, but they had developed the bad habit of turning
> their art form into a math problem to solve. **Art can never be math.**

To be honest, I can't blame him. Unfortunately, most people have had at least
one traumatic mathematical experience. But if you're like Chris Gethard -- if
math makes you feel varying degrees of anxiety, repulsion, existential dread,
and / or rage -- I'd like to invite you to turn the tables with me, and examine
some of Gethard's work through a mathematical lens.

Gethard may not have a high opinion of math, but what does math have to say
about him? Let's find out!

### Beautiful Basics

As mentioned above, one _Beautiful / Anonymous_ episode features a deaf caller.
This experience inspired Chris Gethard to look into providing episode
transcripts of the show, for fans who might not be able to listen to them. In
2019, he released transcripts for 10 episodes curated as part of a [beginner's
guide](https://medium.com/@chrisgeth/a-beginners-guide-to-beautiful-anonymous-dffa5a520f52)
to the podcast.

Unfortunately for Gethard, in so doing he opened a Pandora's box of potential
for quantitative analysis. I went through all of those transcripts and crunched
the numbers, trying to answer questions like:

1. How much talking does Gethard do during the call compared to the caller?
1. How does the _sentiment_ of a typical call change? In general are they 
  positive, negative, or neutral?
1. Given a random line from a transcript, what are some clues that the line
  came from Gethard as opposed to someone calling in?
1. To what extent can we train a computer to talk like Chris Gethard?

In what follows, I'd like to offer some answers to all of these questions. Some
caveats and clarifications:

1. Gethard opens and closes every episode with a few minutes of talking directly
to the listener. He also reads ads a couple of times during each episode. I've
removed all the intro, outro, and ad text from this analysis. The only text I've
considered here is the text that comes from conversation with the caller.
2. Because I only have ten episodes to analyze, rather than the entire library
(which, as of this writing, numbers over 170 episodes), some of the results
you'll see here are biased by the small sample size. More on this below.

With that said, let's check out the results!

### In the Gab

One basic question we can explore is how much each person speaks during a call.
We don't have timestamps available on the transcripts, so instead we'll use word
count as a proxy.

Here's how the number of words spoken by Gethard compares to the number of words
spoken by the caller, for each of the ten episode transcripts: 

<PodcastWordCounts
  data={baSummary}
  caption="Figure 1: Word counts per episode for Gethard and the caller. Tap or mouse over a bar for more details on the episode." 
/>

My biggest takeaway from this graph is that Gethard seems to have gotten much
more comfortable creating space for his guests. He spoke the most in the very
first episode: 6,394 words, more than 67% of the total. 

Overall, though, his guests tend to say more than he does: Gethard only has a
majority of the total words in **three** of these ten episodes, and across the ten
transcribed episodes his share of the words stands at around 44%. If we exclude
his particularly chatty first episode, that percentage drops to 42%.
