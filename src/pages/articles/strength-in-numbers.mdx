Over the past few years, I've read two books that have really left a lasting
impression. One of them is called [The Merchant of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming](https://www.amazon.com/Merchants-Doubt-Handful-Scientists-Obscured/dp/1608193942).
The subtitle says it all; it's an absolutely depressing true story about how a
small group of scientists waged a campaign against science itself, with
remarkable success.

The other is called [Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America](https://www.amazon.com/Give-Us-Ballot-Struggle-America/dp/1250094720).
Once again, it's all right there in the title. This one's the absolutely
depressing true story about how a small group of racists waged a campaign against voting rights for historically disenfranchised groups, again with remarkable success.

While these topics may sound like they fall under umbrellas of science, history,
or civics, there's plenty of related mathematical conversations to be had as
well. In terms of climate change, I wrote a story [last year](https://mattlane.us/stories/warming-dots/) on general mathematical models
of how natural resource depletion can affect populations. In this story, I'd
like to turn a mathematical lens on the topic of voting, and slap a coat of
paint on what would otherwise be a bunch of tabular data.

### The Data

Let's explore results from the past decade of United States elections. Every two
years, we elect our representatives in Congress, along with potentially a
senator or a president. Well after the election is complete, the U.S. Assistance
Commission (EAC) releases survey data on the election. This data includes information
on things like registration, voter participation, and the number of precincts
and poll workers. (More information can be found on their [website](https://www.eac.gov/research-and-data/datasets-codebooks-and-surveys/).)

Along with the data, the EAC provides a report summarizing its findings. But
with a decade of past results to compare against, I was curious about
visualizing their findings across time. How have election patterns changed since
2008, if at all? To start answering this question, I pulled out the information I was curious about, and consolidated it by year. If you're interested, you can find the raw data [here](https://github.com/mmmaaatttttt/personal-site/blob/master/src/data/csv/voting_data_2008_2016.csv).

On their own, unfortunately, numbers aren't the greatest storytellers. Let's try to frame all of these values into a more cohesive narrative.

(Note that results for the 2018 election aren't available yet. I'll add that
data in once it's released.)

### The People

Let's start with the fundamentals: who's registered, who's voting, and who isn't
voting despite eligibility? Using the map below, you can explore how different
states compare across every election since 2008. There are five different
statistics to choose from:

1. **Active Registered Voters.** How many active registered voters did the state
   report for that year? (Mostly this is taken from EAC reporting, though the New
   York data in 2016 is from
   [this](https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/enrollment/county/county_nov16.pdf)
   source.)

2. **Election Participants.** How many ballots were received? Note that in some
   jurisdictions can include rejected provisional ballots. Think of it as a slight
   overestimate for the number of people who successfully voted.

3. **Eligible Voters.** Of all of the folks in the state, how many were
   _eligible_ to vote (at least 18 years old, citizens, and no criminal history
   that would deprive them of their right to vote)? These numbers are taken from
   the [United States Elections Project](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data).

4. **Registration Saturation.** What percentage of eligible voters are active
   registered voters? Note that while this should be a value between 0% and 100%,
   because we're dealing with estimates, there are certain data points with values
   greater than 100%. For example, Kentucky and Maine in 2016 both have saturation
   rates a bit above 100%.

5. **Election Turnout.** What percentage of eligible voters actually
   participated in the election?

Here's how the country has looked through the lens of each of these statistics
since 2008:

<VotingMap

  selectOptions={d.mapOptionsForVoters}

For a clearer picture of the trend across years within a state, here's a second
representation of the same data:

<VotingLineChart
  caption="Figure 2: Line representation of population data by year for a fixed state."
  selectOptionsForStatistic={d.lineOptionsForVoters}
/>

A few observations:

- As you might expect, presidential election years correspond to substantial
  boosts in registration, participation, and overall turnout. For example, the
  graph of nearly every state's election participant figures show a distinctive
  zigzag shape, sloping up during presidential election years and down for the
  midterms.

- In terms of average turnout across years, three of the top five states are
  neighbors (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa). The bottom five performers according
  to this metric are more geographically distributed: the worst offenders are
  Mississippi, Texas, West Virginia, Utah, and Hawaii.

  Here's a table summarizing the findings. You can check out the top or bottom
  performers for either registration saturation or voter turnout. Note that
  North Dakota has no data on registered voters dating back to 2008, which is
  why their saturation number is 0%.

<VotingTable caption="Table 1: Average registration and turnout percentages by state." />

- Among recent elections, states have had a difficult time surpassing the turnout they witnessed in 2008. In fact, 34 states recorded their highest turnout during that election, as opposed to only 13 during the 2016 election.

For more on the percentages, here are histograms highlighting the distrubtion of registration saturation and turnout by year. Note, once again, the impact of a presidential election:

### The Workers

What I like about the EAC data is that it doesn't just track how many people
participated in the election by voting. It also tracks how many people
participated by _working_ on election day. While the data isn't as readily
available, many report how many poll workers a jurisdiction had, and some even
go so far as to report information on the ages of poll workers, or the
difficulty in finding poll workers.

Let's start with the fundamentals. Here are our map and line charts revisited,
but with the focus on poll workers instead of voters. The statistics you can
explore are:

1. **% of Jurisdictions Reporting.** What percentage of jursidictions within a
   state reported counts of poll workers on election day? Note that among those
   reporting, an even smaller number provided information on the ages of their poll
   workers or the difficulty in finding poll workers.

2. **Poll Workers.** How many poll workers worked on election day? Since not
   every jurisdiction in a state reports these numbers, the counts you see should
   be considered a lower bound on the number of poll workers.

3. **Polling Places.** How many polling places were there on election day? Since
   not every jurisdiction in a state reports these numbers, the counts you see
   should be considered a lower bound on the number of polling places.

4. **Poll Workers per Polling Place.** On average, how many poll workers were
   there for each polling place?

5. **Poll Workers per 1,000 Election Participants.** How many poll workers were
   there as a fraction of the population? Here we consider only election
   participants from jurisdictions that reported poll worker information.

6. **Polling Places per 1,000 Election Participants.** How many polling places
   were there as a fraction of the population? Here we consider only election
   participants from jurisdictions that reported polling place information.

7. **Average Difficulty of Finding Poll Workers?** All jurisdictions are asked
   to rate the difficulty of finding poll workers for a given election on a scale
   of 1 (very easy) to 5 (very difficult). This shows an average difficulty score
   across the state, taken from jurisdictions that reported a difficulty.

By each of these metrics, here's how the country has changed over time:

<VotingMap
  caption="Figure 4: Map visualization of poll worker data by year and state."
  selectOptions={d.mapOptionsForWorkers}
/>

Just like before, we can also dig into trends across years for a single state:

<VotingLineChart
  caption="Figure 5: Line representation of poll worker data by year for a fixed state."
  selectOptionsForStatistic={d.lineOptionsForWorkers}
  svgId="state-line-graph-2"
/>

What do you notice by exploring these graphs? Here are some things I noticed:

- There's an interesting association between the average number of poll workers
  per polling location and the political leanings of voters within the state.
  Among the five states with the lowest ratio of poll workers to polling places
  (Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi, Alaska, Pennsylvania), four of them have
  traditionally leaned Republican. Similarly, among the five states with the
  highest ratio (Oregon, Maryland, New York, Virginia, Hawaii), four have
  traditionally leaned Democrat.

  It should be noted that Oregon is a bit of an outlier, since it has a robust
  vote by mail system in place. This has the effect of skewing the poll worker
  per polling place ratio quite high.

- The number of polling places per 1000 participants sometimes says more about
  the mechanics of that state's voting system than anything else. The three states
  with the lowest ratio (Oregon, Washington, Colorado) on average across all
  elections are also the three with the most robust vote by mail programs. On the
  other hand, of the four states with the highest ratio (Utah, West Virginia,
  Mississippi, Pennsylvania), only Utah and West Virginia offer some form of early
  voting.

- With fewer parcipants in off-years, the per capita statistics (poll workers
  and polling places per 1,000 participants) tend to see a boost during the
  midterms.

- Across all states, reported difficulty of finding workers has trended slightly
  upward, from about 3.07 in 2008 to 3.35 in 2016. Total number of jurisdictions
  reporting difficulty also went down substantially between 2014 to 2016 (6,444 to
  3,183).

In addition to reporting on the number of poll workers and the difficulty in
finding them, some jurisdictions also report statistics on the age distribution
of poll workers. Here's a breakdown of those age groups by state and year:

In the aggregate, distribution of poll worker ages has been relatively steady across elections.

### It's Party Time

One other dimension that we haven't considered yet is the political leanings of election participants.

-- why looking at election results can be problematic (personality driven, not every congressional district has option from both parties)
-- here's data on political party affiliation
-- visualization to show influence of party affiliation --- scatterplot? histogram??
-- histogram: bar color = affiliation, slide for year, bins adjust. maybe this is best.
