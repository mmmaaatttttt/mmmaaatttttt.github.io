Over the past few years, I've read two books that have really left a lasting
impression. One of them is called [The Merchant of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming](https://www.amazon.com/Merchants-Doubt-Handful-Scientists-Obscured/dp/1608193942).
The subtitle says it all; it's an absolutely depressing true story about how a
small group of scientists waged a campaign against science itself, with
remarkable success.

The other is called [Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America](https://www.amazon.com/Give-Us-Ballot-Struggle-America/dp/1250094720).
Once again, it's all right there in the title. This one's the absolutely
depressing true story about how a small group of racists waged a campaign against voting rights for historically disenfranchised groups, again with remarkable success.

While these topics may sound like they fall under umbrellas of science, history,
or civics, there's plenty of related mathematical conversations to be had as
well. In terms of climate change, I wrote a story [last year](https://mattlane.us/stories/warming-dots/) on general mathematical models
of how natural resource depletion can affect populations. In this story, I'd
like to turn a mathematical lens on the topic of voting, and slap a coat of
paint on what would otherwise be a bunch of tabular data.

### The Data

Let's explore results from the past decade of United States elections. Every two
years, we elect our representatives in Congress, along with potentially a
senator or a president. Well after the election is complete, the U.S. Assistance
Commission (EAC) releases survey data on the election. This data includes information
on things like registration, voter participation, and the number of precincts
and poll workers. (More information can be found on their [website](https://www.eac.gov/research-and-data/datasets-codebooks-and-surveys/).)

Along with the data, the EAC provides a report summarizing its findings. But
with a decade of past results to compare against, I was curious about
visualizing their findings across time. How have election patterns changed since
2008, if at all? To start answering this question, I pulled out the information I was curious about, and consolidated it by year. If you're interested, you can find the raw data [here](https://github.com/mmmaaatttttt/personal-site/blob/master/src/data/csv/voting_data_2008_2016.csv).

On their own, unfortunately, numbers aren't the greatest storytellers. Let's try to frame all of these values into a more cohesive narrative.

(Note that results for the 2018 election aren't available yet. I'll add that
data in once it's released.)

### The People

Let's start with the fundamentals: who's registered, who's voting, and who isn't
voting despite eligibility? Using the map below, you can explore how different
states compare across every election since 2008.

For a clearer picture of the trend across years within a state, here's a second
representation of the same data:
