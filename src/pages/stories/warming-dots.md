Sometimes, when the problems of the world seem overwhelming, it's worth remembering how small we really are. Physicist [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) summed it up nicely when commenting on a 1990 image of the Earth taken by the Voyager 1 space probe, titled _Pale Blue Dot_:

> The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.

From this perspective, it's hard not to feel insignificant. While this may be cold comfort, in a twisted way it is sort of comforting, in that it makes a lot of the problems that we're facing seem less significant as well. After all, what's the worst that can happen? We fail as a species, and the universe marches on.

But the Pale Blue Dot perspective is about more than just nihilism. It can also help frame some of our global issues in a new light. Take global warming, for instance. The surface of the Earth is warming because of human activity, and we're at a point where our survival as a species is jeopardized because of our rapid changes to the planet.

On the one hand, if Earth is nothing but a pale blue dot, global warming is just one of any number of planetary issues that seem insignificant. But on the other hand, if Earth is nothing but a pale blue dot, then maybe there's nothing unique about it. And if there's nothing unique about it, maybe global warming itself is a phenomenon that could exist elsewhere in the universe, on other planets that host technological civilizations. And if that's the case, maybe there's something we can say about global warming across those planets, and make some guesses about how things might shake out here at home.

This is the perspective of astrophysicist Adam Frank and his colleagues, who recently published a paper exploring exactly this idea. If we are not unique in the universe, then perhaps are problems aren't so unique either: in this case, rather than being insignificant, perhaps issues like global warming are themselves common across the universe.

In their paper, the authors propose a few general models of how an issue like climate change could impact a civilization. In this story, I'd like to highlight some of those models in an interactive way. But before we get there, we'll need to talk a bit about in what sense global warming is a problem, and dust off some simple mathematical models that you may have not used since high school.

### Global Collapse

- problem with global warming is global collapse
- population growth not sustainable forever
