Many things are rotten in the state of tech. From Susan Fowler's [essay](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber) last year on the toxic culture at Uber, to more general reports that [60% of women in tech](https://www.elephantinthevalley.com/) have reported unwanted sexual advances, it's clear that these workplaces aren't quite the bastions of equality and meritocracy that their marketing departments would have us believe.

Course-correcting these issues has recently become big business. An article published in _The Atlantic_ last year, titled ["Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?"](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/), gives us some sense of exactly how big:

> In January 2015, in a keynote speech at the International Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas, Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, announced that his company would devote $300 million to diversity efforts over the next five years. Two months later, Apple pledged $50 million to partner with nonprofits that work to improve the pipeline of women and minorities going into tech, and that spring Google announced that it would increase its annual budget for promoting diversity from $115 million to $150 million.

Unfortunately, to date these investments haven't substantially moved the needle when it comes to who gets hired at big companies like Apple, Google, or Facebook. At least, not yet.

Rather than get on a soap box and propose solutions (whose merits, as a cis-gendered white dude, I feel fairly unqualified to judge), I'd like to take an opportunity to try to dig into some of the problems. More specifically, I'd like to talk about some models of interaction that can yield stark differences in the amount of harassment received by different groups. At the center of it all is a concept called the _Petrie multiplier_, coined in a viral 2013 [blog post](http://blog.ian.gent/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html) by Ian Gent, and named after computer scientist Karen Petrie.

In what follows, I'd like to discuss the original model, offer up a few different spins on it, and then frame some common efforts by big companies to tackle harassment in terms of these models.

### A Model of Harassment

As discussed in Gent's post, the Petrie multiplier argues that when one group outnumbers another, the underrepresented group will receive a disproportionate share of harassment in the community, even if everyone in the group is _equally likely_ to harass another person.

In fact, the argument gets even more quantitative. To abstract things a bit, let's imagine that an organization consists only of people with blue eyes and people with green eyes. Let's further suppose that green-eyed people outnumber blue-eyed people by, say, a 2:1 ratio. In this case, Petrie argues that blue-eyed people will experience _four_ times as much harassment as green-eyed people, assuming that both groups harass one another at equal rates. If the greens outnumber the blues by a 3:1 ratio, blues will experience _nine_ times as much harassment. More generally, if there are _m_ times as many greens, blues should experience _m_ &times; _m_ times as much harassment.

The reason for this is relatively straightforward. Over time, since there are _m_ times as many greens, we should expect the blues to receive _m_ times as much harassment _in total_. But this means they should receive _m_ &times; _m_ times as much harassment as the greens _on average_, since again the greens outnumber the blues by a factor of _m_.

Gent's post simulates the scenario over time: people are selected at random to harass, and they then randomly go harass someone who is not a part of that group.

### Less Overt Aggressions

Every time an incident of harassment occurs, a blue is _m_ times as likely to be the recipient as a green. And since there are fewer blues than greens by a factor of _m_, each blue can expect to

  * multiplier decreases if anyone can say anything to anyone else, but is still large
  * multiplier decreases again if we count people affected rather than incidents

* count incidents heard by ppl in power vs ppl out
