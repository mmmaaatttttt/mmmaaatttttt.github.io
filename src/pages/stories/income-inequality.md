It's a well-established fact that in the United States, [income inequality is increasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States). According to a 2011 [report](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/42729?index=12485) from the Congressional Budget Office, between 1979 and 2011 income for the top 1% of households grew by 275%. Meanwhile, for the bottom 20%, income grew by only 18%.

Looking at different income groups' share of total income tells a similar story. In 1979, the top 1% of earners accounted for 9.6% of total household income in the United States. The top 20% of earners accounted for just under 45.7% of total household income, while the bottom 20% accounted for around 7.7%.

By 2007, this gap had significantly widened. The top 20% of earners increased their share of the pie by almost ten points, to 55%. This increase is almost entirely explained by huge gains by the top 1%, who saw their income share nearly **double** to 18.6%. Meanwhile, the bottom 20% of earners saw their share decrease two points, to 5.7%. And given current trends over the past decade, it's hard to imagine the picture has gotten much rosier for most Americans.
