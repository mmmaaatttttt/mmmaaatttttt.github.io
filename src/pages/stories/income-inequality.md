It's a well-established fact that in the United States, [income inequality is increasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States). According to a 2011 [report](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/42729?index=12485) from the Congressional Budget Office, between 1979 and 2011 income for the top 1% of households grew by 275%. Meanwhile, for the bottom 20%, income grew by only 18%.

Looking at different income groups' share of total income tells a similar story. In 1979, the top 1% of earners accounted for 9.6% of total household income in the United States. The top 20% of earners accounted for just under 45.7% of total household income, while the bottom 20% accounted for around 7.7%.

By 2007, this gap had significantly widened. The top 20% of earners increased their share of the pie by almost ten points, to 55%. This increase is almost entirely explained by huge gains by the top 1%, who saw their income share nearly **double** to 18.6%. Meanwhile, the bottom 20% of earners saw their share decrease two points, to 5.7%. And given current trends over the past decade, it's hard to imagine the picture has gotten much rosier for most Americans.

As the income gap grows, so too does the _wealth_ gap, which measures a family's total assets. According to a [2016 CBO report](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51846), the top 10% of families held 76% of the overall wealth in the United States in 2013, up from 67% in 1989. In contrast, the bottom 50% of families held only 1% of the total wealth in 2013, down from 3% in 1989.

When it comes to income and wealth inequality in America, we're moving in the wrong direction. And I'm not an economist or a policy maker; I have no idea what steps we could take to begin reversing the trend that has emerged over the past 40 years.

I am a mathematician, though, so instead I'd like you to consider a thought experiment.

### Starting from Scratch

Let's imagine that we could blow away all of the complexities in our economy, and create a society where everyone starts out with an equal amount of wealth. The economy is strictly based on bartering: whenever two people meet, they can decide to trade goods between them. This exchange will, of course, have an affect on each individual's wealth.

When two people succesfully barter, presumably they both feel good about the exchange, otherwise they wouldn't go through with it. But it's unlikely that the trade is entirely equal. It's much more likely that after the exchange, one person will have gained some wealth, while the other person will have lost some.

However, to keep things from getting out of hand, there's no concept of debt in our society. When two people meet to barter, the value that they're bartering can never exceed the poorer individual's wealth.

I was first introduced to this idea by mathematician Brian Hayes in his book, [_Group Theory in the Bedroom, and Other Mathematical Diversions_](https://www.amazon.com/Group-Theory-Bedroom-Mathematical-Diversions/dp/0809052172). What first interested me in this hypothetical society is how fair it sounds. Everyone starts out on exactly the same footing, and the rules of the game seem about as fair as can be. Everyone trades in good faith, and nobody can run up a debt by doing so.

If you take a moment to think about how this society is likely to evolve, you might convince yourself that people in the society should behave like gas particles, randomly colliding with one another and exchanging energy. Except instead of energy, these people are exchanging their wealth. Here's what such a simulation might look like:

<EconomySimulation caption="Here's how you might expect our model society to evolve."/>

In the above simulation, each person's wealth is visualized both by his or her speed and by his or her color. Faster circles correspond to wealthier individuals and have a red color, while slower circles correspond to less wealthy individuals and take on more of a blue hue.

SOMETHING ABOUT BAR GRAPH.

Unfortunately, this isn't how our model society actually evolves.
