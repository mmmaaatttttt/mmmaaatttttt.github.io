Relationships can be complicated, unpredictable, and dramatic.


In our [last story](/stories/gaming-relationships-linear), we looked at some examples of modeling the relationship between two people with a few different sets of equations. And while those models grew in complexity, they all shared one common feature: they were _linear_. 

What does this mean? Let's revisit our second model from the previous story. The equations we were modeling were these:

<Latex displayMode={true} str={`
  \\begin{aligned}
  A\\prime (t) &= a \\times B(t) + c \\times A(t), \\\\
  B\\prime (t) &= b \\times A(t) + d \\times B(t),
  \\end{aligned}
`}/>

These were the models that gave us four archetypes for people in relationships: _eager beavers_, _narcissistic nerds_, _cautious lovers_, and _hermits_. 

These equations (along with the other ones in the last story) are _linear_. This is because in both of them, the expressions on the right hand side of the equals sign consist only of constant multiples of the functions we're trying to model (_A(t)_ and _B(t)_), along with optionally any additional _constant_ terms.

In particular, these equations don't involve any more complex expressions involving (_A(t)_ and _B(t)_, such as _A(t)_)
