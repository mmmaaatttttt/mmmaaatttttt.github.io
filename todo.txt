- show district data in color of winning party 
- layout on right side
- add ability to save multiple districts?

LOW PRIORITY
- get more heat map data (mayyybeeeee)
- add meta tags for /stories endpoint
- refactor harassment components, which are super gross
- refactor tooltip functionality to HOC
- do an audit of setState functions to ensure functions are used where next state depends on previous state
- add id numbers to nodes in economy simulation
- add more tests
- sidebars don't always show up
- fix hot reloading issue for blog links
- update packages
- line breaks for katex equations on mobile
- MDX! https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx#mdx-syntax, https://github.com/nhducit/gatsby-plugin-mdx
- add "related stories" to end of each story
- pagination for stories
- search for stories

LOWEST PRIORITY
- look into netlify: https://www.netlify.com/
- add playgrounds section
- figure out how to disable katex warning - need access to webpack config (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43414103/how-to-use-noparse-in-create-react-app)
- make nav update on story to follow scroll
  - have share button
  - have progress bar
- better way to import data into components

  Problems:
  More data isn’t always better
  Data you can get isn’t always a good proxy for what you’re trying to measure
  Gives the impression that transferring knowledge across domains is as simple as currency conversion
  Invest in people too, not technology (https://www.wired.com/story/willie-brown-middle-school-startup-mentality-failed/)
