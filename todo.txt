- https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/add-seo-component/
- ordering by year
- add "related stories" to end of each story
- pagination for stories
- search for stories
- make sure all package updates work
- update all atom tests
- update all molecule tests 
- figure out failing math helper tests
- update all helper files and tests
- integration tests for all stories
- build breaks! fix this


LOW PRIORITY
- research how data is passed to mdx: https://gatsby-mdx.netlify.com/guides/writing-pages-in-mdx
- get more heat map data (mayyybeeeee)
- add meta tags for /stories endpoint
- refactor harassment components, which are super gross
- refactor tooltip functionality to HOC
- do an audit of setState functions to ensure functions are used where next state depends on previous state
- add id numbers to nodes in economy simulation
- add more tests
- sidebars don't always show up
- fix hot reloading issue for blog links
- line breaks for katex equations on mobile

LOWEST PRIORITY
- look into netlify: https://www.netlify.com/
- add playgrounds section
- figure out how to disable katex warning - need access to webpack config (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43414103/how-to-use-noparse-in-create-react-app)
- make nav update on story to follow scroll
  - have share button
  - have progress bar
- better way to import data into components

- voter suppression

  - by county:

    - population / number of polling stations / number of poll workers

    - does voting history have an effect? (e.g. more democratic --> fewer stations?)

    - data on number of thrown out ballots?

- treatise on systems thinking
  - climate
  - racism
  - prison industrial complex
  - libertarianism
  - tech (doctors required to think through ethical consequences?)
  - nutrition
  - forests!
  - math education itself suffers from a lack of systems thinking (not enough integration with ethics, writing, computer science)

  Problems:
  More data isn’t always better
  Data you can get isn’t always a good proxy for what you’re trying to measure
  Gives the impression that transferring knowledge across domains is as simple as currency conversion
  Invest in people too, not technology (https://www.wired.com/story/willie-brown-middle-school-startup-mentality-failed/)
