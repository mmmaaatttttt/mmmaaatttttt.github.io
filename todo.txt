- ordering by year
- add "related stories" to end of each story
- pagination for stories
- search for stories
- fewer decimal places for orchard-game.js

LOW PRIORITY
- get more heat map data (mayyybeeeee)
- add meta tags for /stories endpoint
- refactor harassment components, which are super gross
- do an audit of setState functions to ensure functions are used where next state depends on previous state
- add id numbers to nodes in economy simulation
- add more tests
- sidebars don't always show up
- fix hot reloading issue for blog links
- line breaks for katex equations on mobile
- refactor withCaption to CaptionProvider
- refactor fourweddings interactives (use providers, don't have one megacomponent)

LOWEST PRIORITY
- look into netlify: https://www.netlify.com/
- add playgrounds section
- figure out how to disable katex warning - need access to webpack config (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43414103/how-to-use-noparse-in-create-react-app)
- make nav update on story to follow scroll
  - have share button
  - have progress bar
- better way to import data into components
- HorizontalBar in petrie post -- second one has a line of white (doesn't fill entire bar vertically)

- voting explorer
  - transition effect for line graph
  - dots at years
  - add tests for Graph component
  - show "No Data Available" in SVG if there's no data (line graph, stacked bar charts)
  - make all selectable components searchable
  - have more control over color scale on maps (e.g. for percentages)
  - have line charts go from 2008-2016 even if data misses some years on either side

  DATA:
    - what's up with alabama 2014 (participants per 100 eligible)
      - seems like an error? cf https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sites/default/files/voter-pdfs/turnout.pdf -- participants vs registrants
    - what's up with ny 2010 (poll workers per 1000 participants)
    - for stacked bar charts, put in reverse order (2008-2016, not the opposite)
    - for stacked bar charts, remove 2008
    - check turnout numbers against https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/2016_EAVS_Comprehensive_Report.pdf
      - https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2016/dec/rdo/2012-2016-CVAP.html???
      - participants / estimated eligible voters
      - use google spreadsheets as first source of truth

    - reference this: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/us-more-registered-voters-than-adults/

    - histograms for turnout and saturation over time
    - scratch the bars, just include pie charts for ages
    - scatterplot at the end?
    - data on partisanship?
    - explorable table
    - histogram for turnout


- treatise on systems thinking
  - climate
  - racism
  - prison industrial complex
  - libertarianism
  - tech (doctors required to think through ethical consequences?)
  - nutrition
  - forests!
  - math education itself suffers from a lack of systems thinking (not enough integration with ethics, writing, computer science)

  Problems:
  More data isn’t always better
  Data you can get isn’t always a good proxy for what you’re trying to measure
  Gives the impression that transferring knowledge across domains is as simple as currency conversion
  Invest in people too, not technology (https://www.wired.com/story/willie-brown-middle-school-startup-mentality-failed/)
