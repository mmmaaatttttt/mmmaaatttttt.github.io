  Problems:
  More data isn’t always better
  Data you can get isn’t always a good proxy for what you’re trying to measure
  Gives the impression that transferring knowledge across domains is as simple as currency conversion
  Invest in people too, not technology (https://www.wired.com/story/willie-brown-middle-school-startup-mentality-failed/)
